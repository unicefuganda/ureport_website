The under-five mortality rate is dropping steadily, families are rising above poverty line, and the economy is growing. The combined efforts of Government and development partners toward reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other targets is resulting in notable achievements, and this inspires hope.\r\n\r\nBut the current rate of progress needs to be accelerated greatly to reach the MDGs by the year 2015, and to ensure all Ugandan children can survive and thrive. More than half of Ugandans \u2013 over 18 million \u2013 are under the age of 18 years, underscoring just how important and urgent it is to improve the lives of children and youth, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized. With such a huge young population, the impact of Uganda's achievements for children directly influences the progress of the nation.\r\n\r\nAs the country strides forward economically creating new opportunities for some, the poorest children are left far behind. Compared to those living in the wealthiest quintile (20 per cent), children in the poorest quintile are more than two-and-a-half times less likely to be birthed by a skilled attendant. They are less likely to have official birth registration or be immunized, and are more likely to suffer malnutrition. They are nearly two-and-a-half times more likely than their richest peers to be married before the age of 18, and eight times less likely to be using improved basic sanitation throughout life.\r\n\r\nLike a marathon runner pushing toward the finish line, a sustained and focused effort is needed in Uganda to go the last mile toward reaching the MDGs and other important development targets. This will set the tone for the future beyond 2015, affecting the mortality, safety, and education of millions. With the futures of millions of children kept close at heart, UNICEF Uganda is working with the Government and partners to accelerate progress to Keep Children Alive, Safe, and Learning.\r\n\r\nThree multi-sectoral programme components (Keep Children and Mothers Alive, Keep Children Safe, and Keep Children Learning) form the core of the 2010-2014 Government of Uganda/UNICEF Uganda Country Programme Action Plan. As a whole, the programme benefits from intersecting activity and crosscutting strategies. For example, Alive intersects with Learning where hygiene improvements affect school enrolment; Learning intersects with Safe where weaving child-friendly principles into national education standards reduces child abuse in schools.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Keep Children Alive, Safe, and Learning is to have a dramatic, positive impact on the lives of Uganda's children by the 2015 MDG target year, and beyond. Geographically, we are placing additional focus in areas of high disparities, such as districts in the northern, northeastern, and western-to-central areas. UNICEF is also bolstering development efforts in over 30 additional districts around the country with the highest absolute mortality rates, in an effort to join our partners in having deeper impact in those underserved areas.\r\n\r\nIt is within Uganda's reach to save lives and improve the futures of millions of children a year. We must not wait until tomorrow: the time for us to accelerate progress is now.", "published": true, "slug": "unicef"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "ureport_website.partners", "fields": {"website": "http://ibm.com", "title": "IBM", "image": "2013/10/18/ibm_logo.gif", "created": "2013-10-18 17:02:47", "content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.
